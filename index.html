          <p>Our music can be seen as an expression of each member's individuality. Our name "Cup of Joe" is a slang for "A cup of coffee". Just like a cup of coffee, our music seems ordinary; but there's always that feeling when you take a sip that really calms you down and makes you think and reflect on the finer things in life - a bittersweet blend of coffee that wakes you up and gives you the strength to face the world. This is what our music is all about.</p>
